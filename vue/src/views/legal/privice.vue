This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Third Party websites, marketplaces or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information, as you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information (as defined below). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use FF Services.
	</p>
	<p class="25">
		This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Use &nbsp;and subject to the provisions of the Terms of Use. All other terms not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Use.
	</p>
	<p>
		2.&nbsp;<b>Who May Use our Services</b>.
	</p>
	<p class="27">
		FF Services are only intended for adults eighteen (18) years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from persons under the age of 18, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate their account.
	</p>
	<p>
		3.&nbsp;<b>Scope</b>. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is Processed (as defined below) by FF in the course of our business, including on our Marketplace. All persons whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of FF are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		4.&nbsp;<b>Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It</b>. We collect several types of information from and about customers, users and visitors (collectively “<b>Individuals</b>”) depending on how they are using the Services, including:
	</p>
	<p>
		(a)&nbsp;Types of Personal Information We Collect
	</p>
	<p>
		(i)&nbsp;Information You Provide Directly to Us.

	</p>
	<p>
		(ii)&nbsp;Account Information. If you create an account, we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you.

	</p>
	<p class="27">
		We, as well as Third Parties that provide content or other functionality on our Marketplace, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“<b>Technologies</b>”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "<b>device</b>") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across all relevant devices.
	</p>
	<p>
		(i)&nbsp;Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ devices to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, some features of the Services may not work properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		(ii)&nbsp;Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site or the App that collects information about Individuals’ engagement on the Site or the App. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
	</p>
	<p class="27">
		Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:
	</p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet">
		·&nbsp;Operationally Necessary. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular Service behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;
	</p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet">
		·&nbsp;Performance Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our applications, Services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Services, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, Services, or tools.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet">
		·&nbsp;Functionality Related. We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into your account or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content;
	</p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet">
		·&nbsp;Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first-party or Third Party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Site, or on Third Party websites. This includes using Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.
	</p>
	<p class="27">
		If you would like to opt out of the Technologies we employ through our Services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits. Please note however that certain functionality of the Services may not be available or function properly if you opt out of certain Technology uses.
	</p>
	<p>
		5.&nbsp;<b>Disclosure of Your Information</b><b></b>
	</p>
	<p class="27">
		We only collect Personal Information that we believe to be relevant and required to conduct our business. We may share your Personal Information with our service providers, but only to the extent that they each need to know specific information to continue to provide Services to you. This includes:
	</p>
	<p>
		(i)&nbsp;Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and Marketplace you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; (v) fraud prevention; and (vi) in connection with the provision of the services, including KYC/AML checks. We have executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted Marketplace on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		(ii)&nbsp;Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as required by law and similar disclosures).

	</p>
	<p>
		(iii)&nbsp;Security Reasons. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Marketplace. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify Individuals in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.
	</p>
	<p>
		(iv)&nbsp;Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, we will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
	</p>
	<p>
		(v)&nbsp;For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information. We may disclose aggregated information about our users, which means information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. As an example, we may include in our marketing materials that a certain percentage of our users are female, but we will not share a list of the female users in these materials.
	</p>
	<p>
		6.&nbsp;<b>International Data Transfers</b>. You agree that all Personal Information collected via or by us may be transferred, Processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to the United States, in the cloud, on our servers, on the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to us, you explicitly consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a></a>7.&nbsp;<b>Opt-Out&nbsp;(Right to Object to Processing)</b><b></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		(a)&nbsp;General. You have the right to object to and opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. Where you have consented to our Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information (as defined below), you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out of further Processing by contacting us as described below.
	</p>
	<p>
		(b)&nbsp;Email and Telephone Communications. If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or Marketplace you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding us and our Marketplace and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).
	</p>
	<p>
		(i)&nbsp;We maintain telephone “do-not-call” lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do-not-phone and do-not-contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.
	</p>
	<p>
		8.&nbsp;<b>Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</b>. You can review and change your Personal Information by logging into the Marketplace and visiting your account page.

Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be Processed in line with local laws.
	</p>
	<p class="27" >
		We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Although we make good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
	</p>
	<p>
		9.&nbsp;<b>Data Retention</b>. We retain the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Marketplace or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
	</p>
	<p>
		10.&nbsp;<b>Security of Your Information</b>. We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access. All user information is encrypted through the Marketplace with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Also, we perform regular malware scanning of the Marketplace and all servers and computers used by us to support the Marketplace. All Company employees are required to adhere to our security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user Personal Information. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of the Marketplace, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information to other Individuals on the Marketplace if requested. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to the Marketplace. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Marketplace, and we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
	</p>
	<p class="27" >
		By using our Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by making a notice available to you through the Marketplace or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.
	</p>
	<p>
		11.&nbsp;<b>International Users</b>. By using the Marketplace, we will transfer data to the United States and other global jurisdictions. By choosing to use the Marketplace or otherwise provide information to us, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy and the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with the Marketplace will be in accordance with the Terms of Use.
