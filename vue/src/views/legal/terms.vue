						<h4><b>U.S. Fifty Five Exchange User Agreement</b></h4>
                        <p>
							Last updated: December 2018
						</p>
						<p >
							This User Agreement (hereinafter “Agreement”) is a binding contract governing your use of the U.S. Fifty Five Exchange at us.55.com, any associated APIs and any mobile applications (collectively, the “FF Sites”) operated by Fifty Five Exchange Inc. (“FF”). By signing up to use an account through the FF Sites, you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this User Agreement, as well as our Privacy Policy and E-Sign Consent.  If you do not agree to or accept all of the terms of this Agreement, please immediately discontinue access to, and use of, the FF Sites.
						</p>
						<h4><b>1.FF Services.</b></h4>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">1.1. Eligibility.</b> To be eligible to use the FF Services (as defined below), you must be at least 18 years old. You must also not be a resident of one of the following states:  Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, Hawaii, Vermont, Washington (each, a “Restricted State”).  The list of Restricted States is subject to change at any time.  In the event a state becomes a Restricted State, FF will provide users residing in that state with notice via email, a notification on FF’s site, or other means deemed necessary regarding terminating their access to the FF Services.
						</p>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">1.2. Services.</b> Your FF account (“FF Account”) allows you access to the following FF services (collectively, the “FF Services”): (i) one or more hosted Digital Asset Wallets (each, a “Digital Asset Wallet”) that allow users to transfer, track and store certain supported Digital Assets (“Digital Asset”), and (ii) a Digital Asset exchange platform that allows for the trading of supported Digital Assets for other Digital Assets, accessible at us.55.com, through our API or mobile application (the “Marketplace”).
						</p>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">1.3. Digital Asset Risks.</b> The risks of loss in trading or holding any Digital Asset can be immediate, substantial and irreversible.  There is no guarantee against losses from using FF’s Services.  You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding any Digital Asset is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and needs.  The following are some risks associated with Digital Assets. However, these descriptions are non-exclusive and do not disclose all such risks. Please consider these and other risks carefully before using the FF Services.
						</p>
						<h4><b>• Market Risks.</b></h4>
						<p>The market for Digital Assets is still new, uncertain and highly volatile.  No one should invest in Digital Assets using funds that he or she is not prepared to lose entirely.  Whether the market value for one or more Digital Assets will move up or down, or whether a Digital Asset will lose all or substantially all of its value, is unknown and cannot be predicted. The prices of Digital Assets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile, and a decrease in the price of a single Digital Asset may cause volatility in the entire market. In addition, blockchain networks may go offline because of bugs, hard forks, or other unforeseeable reasons.  Participants in any Digital Asset market should pay close attention to their position and holdings, and how they may be affected by sudden and adverse shifts in trading and other market activities. There is no guarantee that any given price quoted or realized on the Marketplace represents the fair value of the subject Digital Asset.
						
						</p>
						<h4><b>• Liquidity Risks.</b></h4>
						<p>Digital Assets have varying degrees of liquidity.  Some markets are quite liquid while others may be thinner.  Thin markets can amplify volatility.  Factors beyond FF’s control may affect market liquidity for any Digital Asset, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility.   FF makes no representations or warranties about whether a Digital Asset that may be traded on the Marketplace may be traded on the Marketplace any point in the future, if at all.  Any Digital Asset is subject to no longer being supported by FF without notice or consent.</p>
						<h4><b>•  Legal Risks.</b></h4>
						<p>
							The legal characterization of certain Digital Assets may be uncertain.  This can mean that the legality of holding or trading them is not always clear, and may be subject to certain legal requirements or restrictions. Whether and how one or more Digital Assets constitute property, or assets, or rights of any kind may also seem unclear. You are responsible for knowing and understanding how Digital Assets will be addressed, regulated, and taxed under applicable law.
						</p>
						<h4><b>•  Operational Risks.</b></h4>
						<p>
							FF may experience sophisticated cyberattacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the FF Services. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. FF relies on its non-U.S. partner 55 Global Markets for many significant operational aspects of the FF platform provided under a service agreement. The extent of FF’s reliance may increase the operational risks related to the platform, given FF’s lack of control over 55 Global Markets.
						</p>
						<h4><b>•  Custody Risks.</b></h4>
						<p>
							FF may experience sophisticated cyberattacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the FF Services. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. FF relies on its non-U.S. partner 55 Global Markets for many significant operational aspects of the FF platform provided under a service agreement. The extent of FF’s reliance may increase the operational risks related to the platform, given FF’s lack of control over 55 Global Markets.

						<h4><b>2.Creating an FF Account.</b></h4>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">2.1 Registration of FF Account.</b>
							 To use the FF Services, you will need to register for an FF account (an “FF Account”).  During the registration process, we will ask you for information, including your name and other personal information to verify your identity.  We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open an FF Account for you, or suspend, revoke or terminate your account after opening. 
						</p>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">2.2. Identity Verification.</b>
							 During registration of your FF Account, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information for a minimum of five years. You will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted to use certain FF Services. Your access to one or more FF Services, and the limits that apply to your use of the FF Services, may be altered as a result of information collected about you. The information we request may include certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, a government identification, and information regarding your bank account (such as the name of the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number). In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that the information is accurate, authentic and complete. You agree to keep us updated if any of the information you provide changes. You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity, to protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, to comply with anti-money laundering and other legal requirements, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full.
						</p>
						<!-- 3 -->
						<h4><b>3.3.Digital Asset Wallet.</b></h4>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.1. In General.</b>
							 Upon verification of your identity, you will have the ability to transfer, track and store supported Digital Assets by giving instructions through the FF Site (each such transaction, a “Digital Asset Transaction”).
						</p>
						<h4 style="font-size:14px">
							<b>FF reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Digital Asset Transaction as reasonably necessary to comply with laws and regulations or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits. FF cannot reverse a Digital Asset Transaction which has been broadcast to a Digital Asset network. The Digital Asset Wallet services are available only in connection with those Digital Assets that FF, in its sole discretion, decides to support. The Digital Assets that FF support may change from time to time without notice to you.
							</b>
						</h4>
						</br>
						<h4 style="font-size:14px">
							<b>Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Asset Wallet services to transfer or store Digital Assets in any form that is not supported by FF. FF assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use FF Services for Digital Assets that FF does not support.</b>
						</h4>
						</br>
						<h4 style="font-size:14px">
							<b>You assume full responsibility and liability for any loss resulting from intentional or unintentional misuse of your Digital Asset Wallet services, including, without limitation, any loss resulting from depositing one type of Digital Asset to a wallet intended for another type of Digital Asset, regardless of whether the relevant Digital Asset network confirms the applicable Digital Asset Transaction or not. FF assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any such misuse.</b>
						</h4>
						</br>
						<h4>YOUR ACCOUNT WITH US (AND ANY DIGITAL ASSETS HELD IN SUCH ACCOUNT) IS NOT A BANK ACCOUNT OR A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. OUR SERVICES ARE NOT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. NO INTEREST WILL BE PAID ON ANY DIGITAL ASSETS YOU USE TO PURCHASE OR TRADE FOR ANY OTHER CRYPTO ASSETS (OR ANY OTHER THING) WITH OTHER USERS, AND ALL DIGITAL ASSETS DIRECTLY HELD BY US ARE NOT INSURED BY US OR ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. </h4>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.2.Digital Asset Transactions.</b>
							  For any supported Digital Asset on the Marketplace, FF processes transactions according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to FF. Once broadcast to a Digital Asset network, the transaction may be irreversible. A Digital Asset Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Asset network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Digital Asset associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your FF Account balance or be available to conduct transactions. FF may charge network fees to process a Digital Asset Transaction on your behalf. You acknowledge that you will be responsible for paying any such network fees out of your available proceeds. FF reserves the right to delay or cancel any Digital Asset Transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity, or otherwise within its discretion.
						</p>
						</br>
						<h4>WE ARE NOT 	RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DISPUTES AMONG OR BETWEEN USERS REGARDING ANY TRANSACTION. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY ORDER YOU PLACE WILL BE FILLED. ONCE AN ORDER HAS BEEN EXECUTED, THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT BE REVERSIBLE.</h4>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.3.Digital Asset Storage & Transmission Delays.</b>
							 FF securely stores all Digital Asset private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for FF to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Asset Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Asset Transaction for 48 hours or more. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Asset Transaction facilitated by FF may be delayed.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.4.Third Party Payments.</b>
							 FF has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of FF Services). FF is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with Digital Assets transferred using the FF Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. 
							</p>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.5. Modified Protocols.</b>
							 Unless specifically announced on our website or through some other official public statement of FF, we do not support metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins which supplement or interact with a Digital Asset supported by FF (collectively, “Modified Protocols”). Do not use your FF Account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction involving a Modified Protocol. The FF platform is not configured to detect and/or secure Modified Protocol transactions and FF assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect to Modified Protocols.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.6. Airdrops</b>
							 You understand, acknowledge and agree that in the event that a third party or software protocol attempts to or does distribute a Digital Asset, whether or not supported by FF (often known as an “airdrop” or “bootstrap”) to certain wallet addresses, we will treat such airdropped Digital Asset as we would treat any other unsupported Digital Asset. You agree and understand that airdropped Digital Assets do not create a relationship between us and the transferor, sender and/or the related network that created the airdropped Digital Asset, and further, that we are not subject to any obligation as it may relate to the transferor, sender or related network.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.7.Operation of Digital Asset Protocols. </b>
							FF does not own or control any underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Assets supported on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using the FF Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that FF is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that FF makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Digital Asset you store in the FF platform. In the event of a fork, you agree that FF may suspend FF operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that FF may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that FF assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.
						</p>
						</br>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">3.8.Attacks and Other Malicious Activities.</b>
							 FF does not have any ability to prevent or mitigate attacks on any Digital Assets or their underlying protocols and networks. FF reserves the right to take any actions in the event of an attack as determined in its sole discretion, including but not limited to: (i) If FF reasonably believes that a Digital Asset that it supports has been or may be compromised, or is or will be under attack, FF may immediately halt trading, deposits, and withdrawals for such Digital Asset; and (ii) if it is determined that such an attack caused the Digital Asset to greatly decrease in value, FF may discontinue trade activity on such Digital Asset partially or entirely.  FF does not have any obligation to engage in any activities in relation to attacks on any Digital Assets or their underlying protocols and networks.  Resolutions for an attacked Digital Asset will be determined on a case-by-case basis by FF in its sole discretion.  FF makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the FF Services and is not liable for any lost value or stolen property, whether or not FF was negligent in providing the proper security.
						</p>
						</br>

							FF compiles and discloses certain market data, including bid prices, ask prices, trading prices and volume etc. You understand, acknowledge and agree that, due to technical and other restrictions, the Digital Asset values displayed on the FF Sites may be delayed and therefore not reflect the current, live market value of such Digital Asset.

						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">4.9 Trading Account Use.</b>
							By using an FF Account to access the Marketplace, you agree and represent that you will use the Marketplace only for yourself as Account owner, and not on behalf of any third party, unless you have obtained prior approval from FF. You may not sell, lease, furnish or otherwise permit or provide access to your Trading Account to any other entity or to any individual that is not your employee or agent. You accept full responsibility for your employees’ or agents’ use of the Marketplace, whether such use is directly through the Marketplace website or by other means, such as those facilitated through API keys, our mobile application, and/or applications which you may authorize. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all orders, trades, and other instructions entered into the Marketplace including identifiers, permissions, passwords, and security codes associated with your FF Account.
						</p>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">4.10 Suspension and Cancellation.</b>
							We may suspend your FF Account or your access to any one for more Order Books in accordance with the suspension and termination provisions of this Agreement. Suspension or termination of your FF Account shall not affect the payment of fees or other amounts you owe to FF.

						</p>
						<p >

FF reserves the right to cancel any open trades and/or suspend Marketplace activity in accordance with the trading rules or in accordance with applicable law. 
							<h4>FF SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM INTERRUPTIONS OR DOWNTIME.</h4>
						</p>
						<p >
							<b class="fontweight">4.12. No Investment Advice or Brokerage.</b>
							FF does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice, nor does FF broker trades on your behalf.

5.3. Third-Party Applications. If, to the extent permitted by FF from time to time, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your FF Account, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.

At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.
If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this section 6.2 is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this section 6.2 shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this Agreement will continue to apply.
7.General Provisions.
7.1. Computer Viruses. We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from FF. Always log into your FF Account through the FF Site to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.
7.2. Release; Indemnification.  You agree to indemnify and hold FF, its affiliates and service providers, and each of its or their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), harmless from any claim or demand (including attorneys' fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) your use, misuse, or inability to use the FF Sites, the Marketplace and the FF Services; (ii) your breach of this Agreement, or (iii) your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby discharge, acquit, and otherwise release the Indemnified Parties, from any claim or demand (including attorneys’ fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to the use of the FF Sites, the Marketplace, and the FF Services, including, but not limited to, claims relating to the following: negligence, gross negligence, intentional interference with contract or advantageous business relationship, defamation, privacy, publicity, misrepresentation, any financial loss not due to the fault of FF, the FF Sites or the Marketplace, false identities, fraudulent acts by others, invasion of privacy, release or misuse of personal information, disputes with other users of the FF Services, failed transactions, purchases or functionality of the FF Sites, unavailability of the FF Sites, its functions and/or the FF Services and any other technical failure that may result in inaccessibility to the FF Sites, the Marketplace, or the FF Services, or any claim based on vicarious liability for torts committed by users encountered or transacted with or through the FF Sites, the Marketplace or the FF Services, including, but not limited to, fraud, computer hacking, theft or misuse of personal information, assault, battery, stalking, rape, cheating, perjury, manslaughter, or murder.
The above list is intended to be illustrative only, and not exhaustive of the types or categories of claims released by you. This release is intended by the parties to be interpreted broadly in favor of FF, and thus any ambiguity shall be interpreted in a manner providing release of the broadest claims. This release is intended to be a full release of claims, and the parties acknowledge the legally binding nature of this provision, and the nature of the rights given up in connection therewith.
If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states:
“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
If you are a resident of another jurisdiction with a comparable statute or doctrine, you hereby waive such statute or doctrine to the extent permissible under applicable law.  
7.3.  Prohibited Jurisdictions.  FF does not accept customers from the Restricted States.
7.4. Limitation of Liability; No Warranty. IN NO EVENT SHALL FF, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE (A) FOR ANY AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL ASSET ON DEPOSIT IN YOUR FF ACCOUNT AT THE TIME OF THE RELEVANT TRANSACTION (EXCLUDING ALL AMOUNTS NOT CREDITED OR LATER CREDITED TO YOUR FF ACCOUNT) OR (B) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE FF SITE OR THE FF SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF FF HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS MEANS, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONLY (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), THAT IF YOU CLAIM THAT FF FAILED TO PROCESS A BUY OR SELL TRANSACTION PROPERLY, YOUR DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL ASSET AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER TYPES OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED DIGITAL ASSET AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
THE FF SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FF SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. FF DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT ACCESS TO THE FF SITES, ANY PART OF THE FF SERVICES, OR ANY OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN, WILL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE. 
FF IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DIGITAL ASSET MARKET, AND FF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE VALUE OF ANY DIGITAL ASSET. FF makes no representations about the accuracy or completeness of historical Digital Asset price data available on the Site. FF will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for transactions are processed in a timely manner but FF makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing which is dependent upon many factors outside of our control.
IF YOU ARE A NEW JERSEY RESIDENT, the provisions of this Section 7.4 are intended to apply only to the extent permitted under New Jersey law.
7.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, E-Sign Consent, and Appendices incorporated by reference herein comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and FF as to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of this Agreement), and every nature between and among you and FF. Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not govern the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.
7.6. Amendments. We may amend or modify this Agreement by posting on the FF Sites or emailing to you the revised Agreement, and the revised Agreement shall be effective at such time.

We reserve the right to assign our rights without restriction, including without limitation to any FF affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the FF Services. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
7.8. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law or regulation or any governmental agency, local, state, or federal, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected.
7.9. Change of Control. In the event that FF is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
7.10. Survival. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, sections pertaining to suspension or termination, FF Account cancellation, debts owed to FF, general use of the FF Site, disputes with FF, and general provisions, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
7.11. Governing Law. You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and FF, except to the extent governed by federal law.
7.12. Force Majeure. We shall not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
7.13. English Language Controls. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any translation of this Agreement is provided for your convenience. The meanings of terms, conditions and representations herein are subject to definitions and interpretations in the English language. Any translation provided may not accurately represent the information in the original English.

Notwithstanding these minimum verification procedures for the referenced FF Services, FF may require you to provide or verify additional information, or to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction, before permitting you to use any FF Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.
