award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral
decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be
conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for
submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the

applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for
any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a
court decides that any provision of this section 6.2 is invalid or
unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this
section 6.2 shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this Agreement
