		I.&nbsp;<b>Commitment to AML and Sanctions Compliance&nbsp;</b><b></b>
	</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Updated: [NTD: Daollar, please include the date of implementation.]
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Fifty Five Exchange Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its affiliates, the “<b><i>Company</i></b>”) and a wholly subsidiary of Daollar Group Limited is committed to combating money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crimes (collectively “<b><i>Money Laundering</i></b>”). &nbsp;The Company is firmly committed to complying with all laws, regulations and Executive orders applicable to the Company’s business.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Such laws include those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“<b><i>OFAC</i></b>”), and other applicable sanctions rules. &nbsp;In particular, the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, inter alia, by The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “<b><i>PATRIOT Act</i></b>”) (which legislative framework is referred to herein as the “<b><i>Bank Secrecy Act</i></b>” or “<b><i>BSA</i></b>”), requires financial institutions, including money services businesses (“<b><i>MSBs</i></b>”), to help the government detect and prevent money laundering. The BSA requires financial institutions to take a number of precautions to guard against financial crime, including the establishment of anti-money laundering (“<b><i>AML</i></b>”) programs and the filing of reports that have been determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings, and certain intelligence and counter-terrorism matters.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Company aims to prevent its business from being used for money laundering and all other illicit activities. Money Laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origin of criminally derived proceeds so that unlawful proceeds appear to have been derived from legitimate origins or to constitute legitimate assets. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Company will also prohibit any individual, entity, association, or other organization that is a target of United States sanctions laws or regulations (“<b><i>Sanctions Targets</i></b>”) to utilize the Company’s services. The Company will also comply with its obligations under applicable laws to block any property or interest in property of Sanctions Targets, which comes within its control.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Penalties for non-compliance with AML and/or sanctions-related regulations can be severe. &nbsp;Violations could subject the Company to civil or criminal penalties and fines, and officers, directors, employees, contractors, and other representatives of the Company could be subject to penalties, fines, imprisonment, or disciplinary action, including termination. Moreover, violations could result in reputational damage to the Company and loss of confidence in its business.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Individuals who become aware of any suspicious circumstances or who have reason to believe that a violation either of applicable laws or of or this Policy has occurred or may occur should contact the Company’s Compliance Officer immediately.
	</p>
	<h1 style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-36.0000pt;">
		II.&nbsp;<b>Description of Business&nbsp;</b><b></b>
	</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Company currently operates a custodial cryptocurrency exchange network at http://www.55.com, allowing users to exchange cryptocurrencies on its platform (collectively, the “<b><i>Services</i></b>”). Presently, in the United States, the Services only allow for cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency transfers, where a customer can exchange one of the listed cryptocurrencies on the Company’s platform for another listed cryptocurrency. Outside the US, the Company allows fiat to cryptocurrency transfers as part of its Services.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“<b><i>FinCEN</i></b>”), a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, administers and issues regulations pursuant to the BSA and implements and enforces compliance with the BSA and associated regulations. Pursuant to FinCEN administrative guidance, the Company’s operations can be defined as a MSB, and the Company has registered as a MSB with FinCEN.

	<h1 style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-36.0000pt;">
		III.&nbsp;<b>AML/Sanctions Compliance Policy</b><b></b>
	</h1>
	<h2>
		A.&nbsp;<b>Overview</b><b><i></i></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		It is the policy of the Company to comply with all AML laws and regulations, and to guard against the use of the Company’s products and services for money laundering, terrorist financing or other illegal activity. &nbsp;The Company recognizes that the culture of an organization is critical to its compliance with its AML obligations. As such, the Company is committed to ensuring that:
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;its leadership actively supports and understands its compliance efforts;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;efforts to manage and mitigate BSA/AML deficiencies and risks are not compromised by revenue interests;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;relevant information from the various departments within the organization is shared with compliance staff to further BSA/AML efforts;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;it devotes adequate resources to its compliance function;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;the compliance program is effective by, among other things, ensuring that it is tested by an independent and competent party; and
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;its leadership and staff understand the purpose of its BSA/AML efforts and how its reporting is used.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;background:#FFFFFF;">
		The Company developed this Policy based on an assessment of the risks presented by the Company’s business. The risk-based approach (“<b><i>RBA</i></b>”) involves identifying and assessing the money laundering and sanctions risks associated with particular transactions, persons and entities, as well as the geographical areas of operation of the Company’s business. The Company understands that its risk profile will shift as its business develops and expands, so it will revisit its risk assessment on a regular basis and adapt its compliance program accordingly. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;background:#FFFFFF;">
		Based on an assessment of the inherent risks in this industry, the Company has established a comprehensive set of safeguards to reduce its risk profile. The Company has also set a low internal risk tolerance threshold where it will take appropriate efforts to minimize its exposure to the following risk categories: regulatory, reputational, legal, and financial.
	</p>
	<h2>
		B.&nbsp;<b>Analysis of Inherent Risks</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Based on an analysis of the Services, the Company deems that the risk of Money Laundering is moderate because cryptocurrency transfers have inherent risks that require mitigation efforts to detect and prevent potential illicit activity. &nbsp;These risks include:
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:42.7000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Cryptocurrencies, similar to fiat currency, by their nature have been employed as a means to engage in unlawful conduct;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:42.7000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Absent mitigation procedures, cryptocurrency exchange services can be used as part of the layering stage of Money Laundering, where funds are moved or converted from source to source in an attempt to conceal the true source of the funds;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:42.7000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Non-face-to-face transactions are generally vulnerable to or targets of illicit activity;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:42.7000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Cryptocurrency holders may use non-BSA regulated intermediaries to transfer cryptocurrencies to and from the Company;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:42.7000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Other high-risk indicators present in this industry are identified in <u>Exhibit B</u>.
	</p>
	<h2>
		C.&nbsp;<b>Risk-Reduction Measures</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		The Company has implemented a robust set of controls to limit the inherent risks identified above. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;The Company’s Compliance Policy is structured around the five pillars of AML (e.g., establish written policies and procedures, designating a compliance officer, testing the effectiveness of the program at regular intervals, implementing a thorough employee training module, and customer due diligence safeguards). &nbsp;The Compliance Officer will be for responsible for implementing several of these features as identified below. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Customers transfer amount limits. [NTD: Daollar, we suggest a max withdrawal per customer per day of $5,000 worth of cryptocurrency. This may be temporary while we test the features of the exchange and face increased regulatory scrutiny during our license application phase.]
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Time limits on instantaneous transfers. [NTD: Daollar, we suggest a 2-3 day holding period between the time a customer uploads crypto to the Daollar wallet and can withdraw to her/his own wallet.]
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;The Company will work with reputable third-party vendors to further refine the Company’s internal AML protocols. These vendors included BSA regulated institutions.

	<h2>
		D.&nbsp;<b>AML/Sanctions Compliance Officer</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:0.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		The Company will appoint a Compliance Officer who is located in the United States. This individual will be responsible for the administration of this Policy. The Compliance Officer will be available to regulators as needed, and will request certain diligence items as set forth in this policy.
	</p>
	<h2>
		1.&nbsp;<b>Written Policies and Procedures</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Compliance Officer is responsible for developing and implementing, in consultation with the Company, additional written AML/Sanctions compliance procedures as needed to achieve the applicable requirements of the Policy’s elements:
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;implementing controls to identify, deter, prevent, detect, and respond to potential AML/sanctions-related risks;
	</p>
	<p class="20" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;internal communication protocols so that relevant stakeholders are aware of AML related developments within the Company;

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Compliance Officer is also responsible for reviewing the Company’s written policies and procedures, from time to time, making any needed adjustments, and submitting the written policies to the Company’s Board of Directors for approval.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Company’s institution’s management will actively search for suspicious activity. When it is discovered, the Compliance Officer will review it and make a determination as to whether a Suspicious Activity Report (“<b><i>SAR</i></b>”) should be filed.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Compliance Officer will file the SAR with the appropriate legal and regulatory authorities. All supporting evidence for the SAR will be maintained for a minimum of five (5) years, and will be securely stored. The Compliance Officer will report to the board of directors the number of SARs filed, along with a brief summary as to the dollar amount of the suspicious activities and why they were deemed as such.
	</p>
	<h2>
		2.&nbsp;<b>Audit</b><b><i></i></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Company will review its BSA/AML policies and procedures as deemed appropriate by the Chief Compliance Officer&nbsp;from time to time, and in any event no less frequent than once every year. The review will be conducted by an independent auditor (e.g., otherwise unaffiliated with the Company) with requisite knowledge and ability to assess both the Company’s Compliance Policy and implementation measures.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		Promptly following the review, the person (s) performing the independent review will submit a written report to the Company’s Board of Directors. The report will summarize the scope and findings of this review, the reviewer’s recommendations, and the steps that Company’s management has committed to take to address any deficiencies, weaknesses or recommendations. The report also shall address steps taken to remedy any deficiencies previously cited in previous reports and regulatory examinations.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Compliance Officer shall be responsible for promptly addressing any compliance deficiencies, documenting the corrective actions taken, and reporting to the Company’s Board of Directors that corrective actions have been taken.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		If deemed necessary or appropriate by the Compliance Officer, the Company will retain an independent auditor at undefined intervals to ensure effective BSA/AML controls.
	</p>
	<h2>
		3.&nbsp;<b>Training</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><i></i></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		All MSBs are required to have an ongoing employee-training program reasonably designed to ensure that the MSB meets its responsibilities under the BSA. &nbsp;At a minimum, the MSB’s training program must provide training of all new personnel whose duties may require knowledge of the BSA. Depending on the MSB’s needs, training materials can be purchased from industry associations, trade groups or outside vendors, or the Company can develop them. &nbsp;Copies of the training materials are to be retained and made available in the Company for review by examiners upon request. Training of employees should be appropriate to their roles and responsibilities, conducted regularly, and clearly documented.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="text-align:justify;">
		The Compliance Officer is responsible for developing and implementing an appropriate, comprehensive Company-wide training program to ensure that all staff receives BSA and AML training appropriate to their position. &nbsp;Newly hired Company employees will receive appropriate compliance training upon hire prior to performing any transactions for MSB related activities. &nbsp;All training will be documented and copies of the training materials retained and training documentation will be made available in the Company’s files for review by examiners, such as the IRS, FinCEN or state regulator, upon request.

		A.&nbsp;<b>Sanctions Counterparty/Third Party Screening</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		1.&nbsp;The Company will use third-party screening vendors that screens all Exchange Users against the OFAC Lists, the EU Consolidated List, the UK HM Treasury Consolidated List, the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List, and any other list that the Compliance Officer determines to apply. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		2.&nbsp;The Company will ensure that all Exchange Users are screened before any transactions are conducted in connection with the Services. The Company will not do business with any person that is owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by a Sanctions Target. &nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		3.&nbsp;The Company will prohibit any Sanctions Target from using the Services.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		4.&nbsp;The Compliance Officer will develop procedures to ensure that the screening described above is appropriately carried out, and to prevent sanctioned parties or territories from utilizing the Services. Although the Compliance Officer plays a critical role in developing and implementing these procedures, avoiding prohibited transactions and complying with the prohibitions in this program is the responsibility of all Company employees and representatives.

	<h2>
		C.&nbsp;<b>Blocking/Rejecting and Reporting</b><b></b>
	</h2>
	<p class="19" align="justify" style="margin-left:0.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		Where a Company representative discovers a likely sanctions match through screening or otherwise, the representative will escalate the likely match to the Compliance Officer, who will take action, as required, including filing of any OFAC reports or other applicable reports in a manner and within a time frame required by law.

	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		1.&nbsp;The Company will conduct a background check on all Exchange Users using available databases and/or an established third-party provider such as PrimeTrust LLC. The Company and/or such third-party provider is expected to collect the following information from each Exchange User:
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:54.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		·&nbsp;Full legal name

		·&nbsp;Street address
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:90.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		o&nbsp;For an individual, the address must be a residential or business street address.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:90.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		o&nbsp;For an organization or entity, the address must be the principal place of business
	</p>

		·&nbsp;Identification number – consisting of one of the following;
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:90.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		o&nbsp;For a U.S. person (natural or legal), obtain, as appropriate, a taxpayer identification number, such as a Social Security Number (“<b><i>SSN</i></b>”) (for an natural person) or an Employer Identification Number (“<b><i>EIN</i></b>”) (for a legal person);
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:90.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		o&nbsp;For a non-US person (natural or legal), obtain, as appropriate, one of the following: (i) a U.S. taxpayer identification number; (ii) a passport number and country of issuance; (iii) a U.S. government issued alien identification card number; (iv) another government issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard; or (v) alternative, government-issued documentation certifying the existence of the business or enterprise.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:126.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		&nbsp;If an organization or entity does not have an identification number or presents documentation that is unfamiliar, the Compliance Officer must be consulted. The Compliance Officer will consider whether the available documents or other information allow the Company to formulate a reasonable belief that the Company knows the true identity of the user.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		2.&nbsp;The identity of each Exchange User must then be verified. Identity may be verified using documentary or non-documentary methods, or both. In every case, a description of the method and results of the verification process must be recorded and retained in accordance with the Policy’s recordkeeping requirements.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:72.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		a.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Documentary Verification</b><b></b>
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:108.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		i.&nbsp;Valid government-issued identification may be used to verify the identifying information required in Paragraph 1 above. &nbsp;For individuals, this may include documents such as a driver's license or passport. &nbsp;For entities, this may include certified company formation documents or articles of incorporation, or other, similar documents.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:108.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		ii.&nbsp;The Company will not accept unfamiliar identification documents or ones that appear not to have been validly issued. &nbsp;If there are any doubts, Compliance Officer must be consulted.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:72.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		b.&nbsp;<b>Non–Documentary Verification</b><b></b>
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:108.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		i.&nbsp;If allowed by the Compliance Officer, Company representatives may accept other information apart from that described above in order to form a reasonable belief that the Company knows the identity of the Exchange User. This may include interviews of the user, obtaining information from public or commercial databases, checking references with financial institutions, obtaining a financial statement, and searching for negative reporting on Counterparties.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		3.&nbsp;If the Company cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identify of an Exchange User, it may, but is not required to, conduct further investigation of the Exchange User to resolve any red flags and to guard against potential Money Laundering or violations of sanctions. &nbsp;This may include, in the event a transaction raises a “red flag,” inquiring further into the identity of the Exchange User and/or the target recipient. If at any time it is determined that any information provided by an Exchange User is false or was provided fraudulently, the user’s account will be immediately terminated. Other examples of red flags suggesting heightened risk of Money Laundering may include, without limitation, those activities set forth on <u>Exhibit B</u>&nbsp;hereto.
	</p>
	<p class="18" align="justify" style="margin-left:36.0000pt;text-indent:-18.0000pt;text-align:justify;">
		4.&nbsp;If, after completion of the above process, the Company is nevertheless unable to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of an Exchange User, it will not allow the user to utilize the Services.
